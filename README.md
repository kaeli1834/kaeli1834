## 🌟 About Me
Hi there! I'm Karen, a fresh graduate in **Computer Science (Information Systems)** with a specialization in software development.  
I’m passionate about building practical and impactful applications, from **web platforms** to **games in Unity**.  
During my studies and internships, I’ve worked on projects using **Java, C#, Spring Boot, React, Flutter, and Docker**, and I keep learning every day.  

Currently, I’m looking forward to contributing my skills as a **Java Software Engineer** while continuing to explore new technologies. 🚀
